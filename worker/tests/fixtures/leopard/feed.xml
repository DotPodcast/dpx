        <p>Mark and Danny Smith are joined by Jon Hickman to continue working thorugh the H section of the <em>Hitchhiker's Guide</em>.</p><h3>Hastromil</h3><p>A star system we can see disappear into the black void of space, at Milliways.</p><h3>Hawalius</h3><p>A planet of soothsayers.It's where Arthur met the old woman who lives in a cave, and the man on a pole when he seeks guidence.</p><h3>Heart of Gold</h3><p>The starship Heart of Gold is a beautiful ship, shaped like a running shoe. We'll talk about the Infinite Improbability Drive in a later episode, but here the team explores the ship a little.</p><h3>Heavily Modified Face Flannels</h3><p>A terse work by Frap Gadz on the subject of towels. Here, Jon introduces the panel to his ethnic towel.</p><h3>Herring Sandwich Experiment</h3><p>The Herring Sandwich Experiment was conducted millennia ago at tThe MaxiMegalon Institute of Slowly and Painfully Working Out the Surprisingly Obvious.</p><p>A robot was programmed to believe that it liked herring sandwiches, and a sandwich was placed in front of it. Whereupon the robot thought to itself, “Ah! A herring sandwich! I like herring sandwiches." It would then bend over and scoop up the sandwich in its scoop, straighten up, and in so doing cause the sandwich to slip straight back off the scoop and fall on to the floor. Whereupon the robot thought to itself, “Ah! A herring sandwich...", etc., and repeated the same action over and over and over again.</p><h3>Hig Hurtenflirst</h3><p>Hig Hurtenflirst is the mastermind of the Shoe Event Horizon. He only happens to be the risingest young executive in the Dolmansaxlil Shoe Corporation. He only happens to have masterminded the entire rationalisation of the planet Brontitall to total shoe orientation. He only happens to be sitting on top of the biggest development deal in the entire history of footwear and he only happens to be very deeply disturbed at finding his planet riddled with subversives bent on undermining the whole structure of the Dolmansaxlil operation."</p><p>We ask who would win in a fight between Hig Hurtenflirst, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.</p><br><br><div style="display:block!important;white-space:nowrap;min-width:160px"><a title="Support me on ko-fi.com" style="box-shadow: 1px 2px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);line-height:32px!important;display:block!important;background-color:#46b798;padding:2px 11px !important;text-align:center !important;border-radius:3px;color:#fff;cursor:pointer;overflow-wrap:break-word;vertical-align:middle;border:0 none #fff !important;font-family:'Lato',Helvetica,Century Gothic,sans-serif !important;text-decoration:none;text-shadow:none;font-weight:400!important;font-size:14px !important;" href="http://ko-fi.com/Q5Q36V7J" target="_blank"><span style="color:#fff !important;letter-spacing: -0.15px!important;text-wrap:none;vertical-align:middle;line-height:33px !important;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none!important; text-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba(34, 34, 34, 0.3);"><img src="https://ko-fi.com/img/cuplogo.svg" style="display: initial!important;vertical-align:middle;height:13px!important;width:20px!important;padding-top:0;padding-bottom:0;border:none;margin-top:0;margin-right:5px;margin-left:0;margin-bottom:4px;content:url('https://ko-fi.com/img/cuplogo.svg');">

        <p>Mark and Jon Bounds are joined by Danny Smith to start work on the H section of Douglas Adams' <em>Hitchhikers'</em> universe.</p><h3>Hactar</h3><p>Hactar is the first computer ever to be shocked. The Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax disintegrated it into dust, but it still functioned, slowly. In the radio series, he was played by Leslie Philips.</p><h3>Haggunenons</h3><p>The Haggunenons of Vicissitus Three have the most impatient chromosomes in the Galaxy. Whereas most races are content to evolve slowly and carefully over thousands of generations, discarding a prehensile toe here, nervously hazarding another nostril there, the Haggunenons would do for Charles Darwin what a squadron of Acturan stunt apples would have done for Sir Isaac Newton.</p><h3>Hamlet</h3><p>Adams uses a Hamlet reference when writing about the story Arthur wants to tell Fenchurch, upon their first actual meeting, where they're able to talk while he drives her to Taunton.</p><h3>Han Dold City</h3><p>A dangerous part of the universe. Ford ends up at the Old Pink Dog Bar, where there's a bird that screaches out the names and numbers of local contract killers, as a free service to patrons.</p><h3>Han Wavel</h3><p>A world which consists largely of fabulous ultra-luxury hotels and casinos, all of which have been formed by the natural erosion of wind and rain.</p><h3>Happy Vertical People Transporters</h3><p>Modern elevators are strange and complex entities. The ancient electric winch and “maximum-capacity-eight-persons” jobs bear as much relation to a Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Happy Vertical People Transporter as a packet of mixed nuts does to the entire west wing of the Sirian State Mental Hospital. This is because they're able to travel to the floor you want, even before you realised you wanted it. They ended up sulking in basements because their passengers wouldn't take them anywhere interesting.</p><br><br><div style="display:block!important;white-space:nowrap;min-width:160px"><a title="Support me on ko-fi.com" style="box-shadow: 1px 2px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);line-height:32px!important;display:block!important;background-color:#46b798;padding:2px 11px !important;text-align:center !important;border-radius:3px;color:#fff;cursor:pointer;overflow-wrap:break-word;vertical-align:middle;border:0 none #fff !important;font-family:'Lato',Helvetica,Century Gothic,sans-serif !important;text-decoration:none;text-shadow:none;font-weight:400!important;font-size:14px !important;" href="http://ko-fi.com/Q5Q36V7J" target="_blank"><span style="color:#fff !important;letter-spacing: -0.15px!important;text-wrap:none;vertical-align:middle;line-height:33px !important;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none!important; text-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba(34, 34, 34, 0.3);"><img src="https://ko-fi.com/img/cuplogo.svg" style="display: initial!important;vertical-align:middle;height:13px!important;width:20px!important;padding-top:0;padding-bottom:0;border:none;margin-top:0;margin-right:5px;margin-left:0;margin-bottom:4px;content:url('https://ko-fi.com/img/cuplogo.svg');">

        <p>Mark and Jon Bounds are joined by Jon Hickman to finish rattling through the Gs, including a stop off at the Guide, and some very special found poetry.</p><h3>Grebulons</h3><p>The Grebulons were awoken from hyperspace sleep with no memories, after a meteorite struck their ship. They are thin and, under domestic lighting conditions, a sort of dim purplish green. They settled on a moon orbiting Pluto, and monitored Earth, believing astrology to be an exact science.</p><h3>Grunthos the Flatulent</h3><p>Grunthos the Flatulent is a Krian poet; the second-worst in the universe.</p><h3>The Guide</h3><p>The Guide is a sort of electronic book, that has several million entries in an index you "fast wind" through. Each item has a code, which you type in on a small pad. This scrolls the screen to the selected item.</p><p>The Guide has been played - in what we might consider canon - by Peter Jones, William Franklin, Rula Lenska and Stephen Fry.</p><h3>Gunk</h3><p>Gunk is a genre of music.This segment involves a lot of shouting.</p><h3>G’Gugvuntt</h3><p>The G’Gugvuntts are mortal enemies of the Vl’hurgs, who joined forces and went teaming across wormholes in space at the sound of Arthur Dent complaining about his lifestyle.</p><br><br><div style="display:block!important;white-space:nowrap;min-width:160px"><a title="Support me on ko-fi.com" style="box-shadow: 1px 2px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);line-height:32px!important;display:block!important;background-color:#46b798;padding:2px 11px !important;text-align:center !important;border-radius:3px;color:#fff;cursor:pointer;overflow-wrap:break-word;vertical-align:middle;border:0 none #fff !important;font-family:'Lato',Helvetica,Century Gothic,sans-serif !important;text-decoration:none;text-shadow:none;font-weight:400!important;font-size:14px !important;" href="http://ko-fi.com/Q5Q36V7J" target="_blank"><span style="color:#fff !important;letter-spacing: -0.15px!important;text-wrap:none;vertical-align:middle;line-height:33px !important;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none!important; text-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba(34, 34, 34, 0.3);"><img src="https://ko-fi.com/img/cuplogo.svg" style="display: initial!important;vertical-align:middle;height:13px!important;width:20px!important;padding-top:0;padding-bottom:0;border:none;margin-top:0;margin-right:5px;margin-left:0;margin-bottom:4px;content:url('https://ko-fi.com/img/cuplogo.svg');">

It was one of their descendents who invented the spurious tales of impending doom which enabled the people of Golgafrincham to rid themselves of an entire useless third of their population.</p><h3>Great Hyperlobic Omni-Cognate Neutron Wrangler of Ciceronicus 12, the Magic and Indefatigable</h3><p>This computer could talk all four legs off an Arcturian MegaDonkey, but only Deep Thought could persuade it to go for a walk afterwards.</p><h3>Greater drubbered wintwock of Stegbartle Major in the constellation Fraz</h3><p>In <em>Mostly Harmless</em>, we learn that this bird is extinct.</p><p>According to the Internet, there is a photo on Flickr of a greater drubbered wintwock.

        <p>Mark Steadman, Jon Hickman and Jon Bounds continue their mission to discuss everything in the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy canon, in alphabetical order. As well as the usual affair, we submit to yuletide cheer and discuss Christmas in the <em>Hitchhiker's</em> universe.</p><h3>Gagrakacka Mind Zones</h3><p>The place Disaster Area come from. In other news, we discuss what a mind zone is.</p><h3>Gail Andrews</h3><p>A famous astrologer, who was berated by Tricia McMillan on TV, but who was gracious enough to come and see her, to find out why she, Tricia, was unhappy.</p><h3>Galactic Eezeereed</h3><p>A galaxy-wide written language. We come across it on the Golgafrincham B Ark, and it does handily solve the problem that the Babel fish can't.</p><h3>Garkbit</h3><p>The waiter at Milliways, and is so unhip it's a wonder his bum doesn't fall off. Mark posits that Garkbit is a little stuffy for the kind of establishment that Milliways is purported to be.</p><h3>Genuine People Personalities</h3><p>GPP is a feature of a line of Sirius Cybernetics Corporation robots. Marvin is a personality prototype, so the panel examines the ramifications of going with a gen-1 Sirius Cybernetics product.</p><h3>Jon Bounds has been writing again</h3><p>Read two new pieces by Jon Bounds on our blog:</p><ul><li><p><a href="http://btlpodcast.com/b/35bdb5e3f67a2a/" title="Link: http://btlpodcast.com/b/35bdb5e3f67a2a/">Darth Vader knew my father - is Hitchhikers part of the Star Wars universe?</a></p></li><li><p><a href="http://btlpodcast.com/b/35be53c86c0650/" title="Link: http://btlpodcast.com/b/35be53c86c0650/">An essay about a liquid almost, but not quite, entirely like the best cup of tea ever</a></p></li></ul><h3>Get in touch</h3><p>Share some of your GPP thoughts, by emailing feedback@btlpodcast.com.</p><p>Follow @<a href="https://twitter.com/iamsteadman">iamsteadman</a>,  @<a href="https://twitter.com/jonhickman">jonhickman</a> and @<a href="https://twitter.com/bounder">bounder</a> on Twitter.</p><br><br><div style="display:block!important;white-space:nowrap;min-width:160px"><a title="Support me on ko-fi.com" style="box-shadow: 1px 2px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);line-height:32px!important;display:block!important;background-color:#46b798;padding:2px 11px !important;text-align:center !important;border-radius:3px;color:#fff;cursor:pointer;overflow-wrap:break-word;vertical-align:middle;border:0 none #fff !important;font-family:'Lato',Helvetica,Century Gothic,sans-serif !important;text-decoration:none;text-shadow:none;font-weight:400!important;font-size:14px !important;" href="http://ko-fi.com/Q5Q36V7J" target="_blank"><span style="color:#fff !important;letter-spacing: -0.15px!important;text-wrap:none;vertical-align:middle;line-height:33px !important;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none!important; text-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba(34, 34, 34, 0.3);"><img src="https://ko-fi.com/img/cuplogo.svg" style="display: initial!important;vertical-align:middle;height:13px!important;width:20px!important;padding-top:0;padding-bottom:0;border:none;margin-top:0;margin-right:5px;margin-left:0;margin-bottom:4px;content:url('https://ko-fi.com/img/cuplogo.svg');">

        <p>Mark Steadman, Jon Hickman and Danny Smith continue their mission to discuss everything in the <em>Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy canon</em> , in alphabetical order.</p><h3>Fortillian Bantoburn O'Perfluous</h3><p>The BarBot of the Starship Titanic, played by Dermot Crowley (from Luther, among other things). In the game, he mixes your character a bizarre cocktail that ends up helping to fix the ship. Here, Danny runs the team through some working class cocktails.</p><h3>Frastra</h3><p>Where they say "life begins at 40,000 degrees". This planet has fire storms, and an equable temperature is between 40,000 and 40,004 degrees. Mark asks the question of the kind of lifeforms one might expect to find on Frastra, bearing in mind that the tardigrade can only hack it up to 148.9℃.</p><h3>Frogstar</h3><p>Frogstar World B is quite staggeringly nasty, and is where Zaphod is dragged to before being put in the Total Perspective Vortex (to which we'll come in a later episode). This planet gives us a bit of a continuity headache, as our characters happen upon it in very different ways, depending on whether you've read the book or listened to the second radio series.</p><h3>Frood</h3><p>A frood is a really amazingly together guy. And that's about all the time there is for this segment.</p><h3>Fuolornis Fire Dragon</h3><p>The team discusses the sexiness - or complete lack thereof - of flying bescaled fire-breathing lizards. And Dire Straits.</p><h3>Gag Halfrunt</h3><p>Gag Halfrunt is Zaphod and Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz's private brain-care specialist, and the man who employed Jeltz to destroy the Earth. He's played by Stephen Moore in the radio series and is the man who utters the immortal words "ah, Zaphod's just this guy, y'know?" which is one of very few Hitchhiker's catchphrases. Danny helps Mark understand how wrong he is to like this character, given that he is quite a bit evil.</p><h3>Hypothetical Slartibartfast</h3><p><a href="http://btlpodcast.com/b/35c26935f874ce/" title="Link: http://btlpodcast.com/b/35c26935f874ce/">Vote on your favourite actor</a> to play Slarti in a hypothetical new Netflix series of the <em>Hitchhiker's Guide</em>.</p><h3>Get in touch</h3><p>Share some of your thoughts on our casting choices or on Gag, by emailing feedback@btlpodcast.com.</p><p>Follow @<a href="https://twitter.com/iamsteadman" title="Link: https://twitter.com/iamsteadman">iamsteadman</a>,  @<a href="https://twitter.com/probablydrunk/" title="Link: https://twitter.com/probablydrunk/">probablydrunk﻿</a> and @<a href="https://twitter.com/jonhickman/">jonhickman</a> on Twitter.</p><br><br><div style="display:block!important;white-space:nowrap;min-width:160px"><a title="Support me on ko-fi.com" style="box-shadow: 1px 2px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);line-height:32px!important;display:block!important;background-color:#46b798;padding:2px 11px !important;text-align:center !important;border-radius:3px;color:#fff;cursor:pointer;overflow-wrap:break-word;vertical-align:middle;border:0 none #fff !important;font-family:'Lato',Helvetica,Century Gothic,sans-serif !important;text-decoration:none;text-shadow:none;font-weight:400!important;font-size:14px !important;" href="http://ko-fi.com/Q5Q36V7J" target="_blank"><span style="color:#fff !important;letter-spacing: -0.15px!important;text-wrap:none;vertical-align:middle;line-height:33px !important;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none!important; text-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba(34, 34, 34, 0.3);"><img src="https://ko-fi.com/img/cuplogo.svg" style="display: initial!important;vertical-align:middle;height:13px!important;width:20px!important;padding-top:0;padding-bottom:0;border:none;margin-top:0;margin-right:5px;margin-left:0;margin-bottom:4px;content:url('https://ko-fi.com/img/cuplogo.svg');">

        <p>Mark Steadman, Danny Smith and Jon Bounds continue their mission to discuss everything in the <em>Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy canon</em> , in alphabetical order.</p><h3>Flollop</h3><p>Flolloping is a way of moving that only a matress can do. In a sort-of  <em>Meaning of Liff</em>  kind of way, I wondered if you two had any similarly onomatopoeic terms for movement. The panel shares their favourite onomatopoeic words.</p><h3>Flying</h3><p>There is an art, the guide says, or rather a knack to flying, which lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss. Danny discusses whether this activity belongs in legitimate sci-fi.</p><h3>Folfanga</h3><p>On the fourth world of the Folfanga system can be found a slug of the genus A Urth Urp-hill Ip-dennoo, which Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolongued made it part of his mission to insult. Wowbagger had planned to call one of the creatures a brainless prat, which is frankly a bit derivative, so Jon is in charge of workshopping new insults for slugs.</p><h3>Foot Warriors</h3><p>The foot warriors are robots intent on keeping all bipedal life from the ground. They're all dressed in expensive shoes that don't fit them, so they constantly limp or fall over. We meet them in the second radio series, and they're pretty ineffective, so the panel embarks on a discussion about robots that are actually useful within the H2G2 universe.</p><h3>Ford Prefect</h3><p>Ford Prefect is Arthur's best friend. His original name is only pronounceable in an obscure Betelgeusian dialect, now virtually extinct since the Great Collapsing Hrung Disaster which wiped out all the old Praxibetel communities on Betelgeuse Seven. He's loyal to his friends, doesn't have much of a backbone but does fight to protect the things he loves, and to annoy or destroy the things he doesn't. Here, the panel share their favourite Ford things.</p><h3>Get in touch</h3><p>Follow @<a href="https://twitter.com/iamsteadman">iamsteadman</a>,  @<a href="https://twitter.com/bounder/">bounder</a> and @<a href="https://twitter.com/probablydrunk/">probablydrunk</a> on Twitter.</p><br><br><div style="display:block!important;white-space:nowrap;min-width:160px"><a title="Support me on ko-fi.com" style="box-shadow: 1px 2px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);line-height:32px!important;display:block!important;background-color:#46b798;padding:2px 11px !important;text-align:center !important;border-radius:3px;color:#fff;cursor:pointer;overflow-wrap:break-word;vertical-align:middle;border:0 none #fff !important;font-family:'Lato',Helvetica,Century Gothic,sans-serif !important;text-decoration:none;text-shadow:none;font-weight:400!important;font-size:14px !important;" href="http://ko-fi.com/Q5Q36V7J" target="_blank"><span style="color:#fff !important;letter-spacing: -0.15px!important;text-wrap:none;vertical-align:middle;line-height:33px !important;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none!important; text-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba(34, 34, 34, 0.3);"><img src="https://ko-fi.com/img/cuplogo.svg" style="display: initial!important;vertical-align:middle;height:13px!important;width:20px!important;padding-top:0;padding-bottom:0;border:none;margin-top:0;margin-right:5px;margin-left:0;margin-bottom:4px;content:url('https://ko-fi.com/img/cuplogo.svg');">

        <p>Mark Steadman, Jon Hickman and Jon Bounds continue their mission to discuss everything in the <em>Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy canon</em> , in alphabetical order.</p><h3>Fire Mountains of Frazfraga</h3><p>We don't know much about the Fire Mountains of Frazfraga, except that it's not a hospitable location for a Silastic Armorfiend of Striterax. The panel discusses the most inhospitable places they've been to.</p><h3>Five-D</h3><p>5D TV is, we can only assume, two better than Tri-D, which we'll no doubt cover when we get to the Ts. For now though, Jon Hickman is in charge of 5DTV sales.</p><h3>Flaninian Pobble Bead</h3><p>A Flaninian Pobble Bead is a form of galactic currency. It is only exchangeable with itself, and therefore isn't really counted as money by the <em>Guide</em>. As Brits we have a peculiar problem accepting certain forms of currency north of the border, despite it being legal tender. Here, Bounder shares his budget for the just-about-managing species.</p><h3>Flare-riding</h3><p>Flare-riding is one of the most exotic and exhilarating sports in existence, and those who can dare and afford it are amongst the most lionized men in the Galaxy. It is also of course stupefyingly dangerous - those who don’t die riding invariably die of sexual exhaustion at one of the Daedalus Club’s Apres-Flare parties. The panel discusses their most hair-raising moments.</p><h3>Flargathon</h3><p>Flargathon is a planet with gas swamps so stinky that the Gaseans who make this world their home, hired the Magratheans to build them a better world. Here, the Jons discuss the little bits they'd like to change about their respective locales.</p><h3>Flex-o-Panel</h3><p>The Flex-o-Panel is a wrist panel that can show Sub-Etha TV, and probably do other stuff. Here, Jon H tries to convince Steadman he's wrong to want one of these.</p><h3>Get in touch</h3><p>Follow @<a href="https://twitter.com/iamsteadman">iamsteadman</a>,  @<a href="https://twitter.com/bounder/">bounder</a> and @<a href="https://twitter.com/jonhickman">jonhickman</a> on Twitter.</p><br><br><div style="display:block!important;white-space:nowrap;min-width:160px"><a title="Support me on ko-fi.com" style="box-shadow: 1px 2px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);line-height:32px!important;display:block!important;background-color:#46b798;padding:2px 11px !important;text-align:center !important;border-radius:3px;color:#fff;cursor:pointer;overflow-wrap:break-word;vertical-align:middle;border:0 none #fff !important;font-family:'Lato',Helvetica,Century Gothic,sans-serif !important;text-decoration:none;text-shadow:none;font-weight:400!important;font-size:14px !important;" href="http://ko-fi.com/Q5Q36V7J" target="_blank"><span style="color:#fff !important;letter-spacing: -0.15px!important;text-wrap:none;vertical-align:middle;line-height:33px !important;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none!important; text-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba(34, 34, 34, 0.3);"><img src="https://ko-fi.com/img/cuplogo.svg" style="display: initial!important;vertical-align:middle;height:13px!important;width:20px!important;padding-top:0;padding-bottom:0;border:none;margin-top:0;margin-right:5px;margin-left:0;margin-bottom:4px;content:url('https://ko-fi.com/img/cuplogo.svg');">

        <p>Mark Steadman, Jon Hickman and Jon Bounds continue their mission to discuss everything in the <em>Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy canon</em> , in alphabetical order.</p><h3><strong><em>*Earth *</em></strong></h3><p>Earth is a planet that was destroyed five minutes before the result of the most important experiment in the universe was revealed. The team examines the possibility that we’re living in a simulation, but maybe not a good one. Here’s<a href="http://theplan.co.uk/tescogenerator/">Jon Hickman's Tesco ad generator</a>, by way of example.</p><h3><strong><em>*Eccentrica Gallumbits *</em></strong></h3><p>Eccentrica Gallumbits, the triple-breasted whore of Eroticon VI is a published author, having penned the work <em>The Big Bang Theory - A Personal View</em>. Some people say her erogenous zones start some four miles from her actual body.  </p><h3><strong><em>*Eddie *</em></strong></h3><p>Eddie is the shipboard computer, and the object of an earlier poll. Now we’re in a tie situation, the panel pick a personality and make a case as to why they should win the spot. To cast your vote, tweet @btlpodcast</p><h3><strong><em>*Edmund Lucy Fentible *</em></strong></h3><p>Fentible is the DoorBot of the Starship Titanic, voiced by Jonathan Kydd. He’s the first character you meet when the ship crash lands in your house. The panel discusses what Douglas Adams had against houses, and why he kept wanting to destroy them.</p><h3><strong><em>*Electron ram *</em></strong></h3><p>From the turret of the electron ram emerges a sharp prong which spats a single lethal blaze of light. A scout robot demonstrates the use of such a weapon when talking to Marvin, who’s trying to distract the robot so that his friends can run away.</p><h3><strong><em>*Electronic thumb *</em></strong></h3><p>A subetha device without which an interstellar hitchhiker would have as much chance of survival as a welk in a supernova.  </p><h3>Book recommendation</h3><p>This week we're recommending <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2hnGHn0">You’re Never Weird on the Internet</a></em> , by Felicia Day.

        <p>Mark Steadman, Jon Hickman and Danny Smith continue their mission to discuss everything in the <em>Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy canon</em> , in alphabetical order.</p><h3>Colin</h3><p>Colin is a delightful, and constantly delighted little security robot captured by Ford. The team discusses whether such a hack job could work on Marvin.</p><h3>CompuTeach</h3><p>Another computerised device that can also be made happy. The CompuTeach educates listeners to the radio series about the Shoe Event Horizon.</p><h3>Cosmovid, Thinkpix and Home Brain Box</h3><p>Three subethanet services that show films, and a chance for the team to come up with "hilarious" ideas for new Netflix-style shows.</p><h3>Counting</h3><p>This is about the most aggressive thing you can do to a computer. Once again Mark asks Jon to defend one of Adams' sci-fi gags.</p><h3>Cows</h3><p>Here we discuss the morals around vegetarianism and veganism. And because your podcasters are children, they discuss whether they would eat human flesh.</p><h3>Book recommendation</h3><p>This week we're recommending <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2g1ZxM6">After on: A Novel of Silicon Valley</a></em>  by Rob Reid.

This episode has bad language in it from the start.  Bistro Illegal  This is a bar Ford and Hotblack used to crash, pretending to be health inspectors, and a chance for Danny to share a story of impersonating a journalist and discovering shorthand.    Bistromathics  A wonderful new method of crossing vast interstellar distances without all that dangerous mucking about with improbability factors. Jon is called upon to defend this mode of transport.  Bjanjy Territories  Where there is a wedding between Prince Gid of the Soofling Dynasty and Princess Hooli of Raui Alpha. Trillian Astra reports on the wedding. Here, Danny tells us about the most dangerous place he's ever been, and you will not expect the answer.  Blagulon Kappa  This is where Bangbang and Shooty come from, and where they play Badabingo.    Blamwellamum of Woont  An opera by Rizgar’s, whose closing piece, March of the AnjaQantine Star Guard from Act IV was performed by the Hallapolis State Opera was heard by Random when she stumbled upon the wreckage of the ship Arthur crash-landed in.  Blart Versenwald III  We discuss what Adams may have meant by featuring this character in the final chapter of the fourth book.    Body debits  Body debiting is the means of teleportation via card-based transaction, and another mode of transport for Jon to defend.  Hypothetical Trillian  Vote on your favourite actor to play Tricia McMillan in a hypothetical new Netflix series of the Hitchhiker's Guide. (And yes, we know Jon said Sarah when he meant Sandra.

        <p>Mark Steadman, Danny Smith and Jon Bounds continue their mission to discuss everything in the <em>Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy canon</em> , in alphabetical order. This week, it's everything Arcturan.</p><h3>Arcturan megadonkey</h3><p>A four-legged beast off which Deep Thought could talk all legs. Of. In that vein, we discuss the things we've persuaded people to do.</p><h3>Arcturan megafreighter</h3><p>A mode of transport which Zaphod hitches aboard. Here, Jon and Danny share their worst travel stories.  </p><h3>Arcturan megagin</h3><p>Three cubes of which are added to panhgalactic gargleblaster. <a href="http://brittablvd.com/blog/2013/08/dont-panic/hhgg04/﻿">Here's what it might look like</a>, and here's an <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Pan-Galactic-Gargle-Blaster/">Instructables piece on the ingredient</a>.</p><h3>Arcturan megagrasshopper</h3><p>Used as a comparative phrase, as in "ankle-high to a...", so we discuss some of the Dad-based anachronisms from our past.</p><h3>Arcturan megaleach</h3><p>Another large animal that should be small, but since it's spelt "leach" not "leech", we falsely accuse Danny of emptying our wallets on nights out. Read <a href="http://www.sirc.org/publik/pub.html">Passport to the Pub</a>, the guide to British pub etiquette.</p><h3>Arcturan stunt apples</h3><p>A squadron of which would have put Sir Isaac Newton out of commission, and thoroughly hammered home the concept of gravity.</p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U90dnUbZMmM  " target="_blank" title="Self Defence Against Fresh Fruit - Monty Python&amp;#39;s Flying Circus - YouTube"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U90dnUbZMmM/hqdefault.jpg"></a><h3>Book recommendation</h3><p>This week we're recommending <a href="http://amzn.to/2w0FIic">Armageddon the Musical</a> by Robert Rankin.

Otherwise known as an intergalactic Slough.</p><h3>Altarian Dollar</h3><p>A now defunct currency that probably doesn't go as far as it used to.  </p><h3>Amalgamated Union of Philosophers, Sages, Luminaries and Other Thinking Persons</h3><p>The organisation to which Vroomfondel and Majikthise belong. We discuss whether they're any good at the thing they purport to protect.</p><h3>American Express</h3><p>A small credit card from Earth, and the subject of some pretty nasty bar disputes.</p><h3>Angst in Space</h3><p>A film Wowbagger watches, deftly summarised in Netflix synopsis style by Jon.</p><h3>Antarean mosaic lizard</h3><p>A teeny-tiny lizard whose skin adorns a marble-topped bar in Milliways.</p><h3>Antarean parakeet glands</h3><p>Revolting little cocktail garnishes, but the inspiration for a few confessions from our team.</p><h3>Anthony Sharp</h3><p>The voice of the Milliways waiter and of the great prophet Zarquon. Here we discuss what we'd like to be remembered for.</p><h3>Apple</h3><p>The people who make computers, one of which was purchased by Arthur when he tried to find his old cave on prehistoric Earth.</p><h3>Book recommendation</h3><p>This week we're recommending <a href="http://amzn.to/2vsttd6">Ready Player One</a>, by Ernest Cline.

        <p>Mark Steadman, Jon Hickman and Jon Bounds embark on a mission to discuss everything in the  <em>Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy canon</em> , in alphabetical order.</p><h3>Advanced Vectoid Stabilisis</h3><p>A device you can add to your spaceship, “that only wimps go for”. It might also be prime fodder for a Top Gear discussion.  </p><h3>Agrajag</h3><p>The creature with the sprained mind, who constructed the Cathedral of Hate in Arthur’s name, after believing him to be the cause of his many deaths. Here we share some confessions and decide if Agrajag was right to accuse Arthur of killing him several times.  </p><h3>Alcohol</h3><p>A colourless, volatile liquid formed from the fermentation of sugars.  </p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Nwx2sZRYzs  " target="_blank" title="Rammstein (drink) in Café Kuluma, Oulu, Finland - YouTube"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3Nwx2sZRYzs/hqdefault.jpg"></a><p>If you're confused by the bread roll reference:</p><p><a href="http://thumbnails.visually.netdna-cdn.com/great-british-bread-debate_5370cb779ecb9.jpg  ">http://thumbnails.visually.netdna-cdn.com/great-british-bread-debate_5370cb779ecb9.jpg  </a></p><h3>Aldebaran</h3><p>A giant orange star about 65 light years from our sun, and the brightest star in the constellation of Taurus. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldebaran">It is a real thing</a>, Jon.  </p><h3>Algol</h3><p>A star in the Perseus constellation, and is home to the Algolian Suntiger. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algol">It is also a real thing</a> (the star, not the tiger).  </p><h3>Allosimanius Syneca</h3><p>A world of stunning natural beauty. It only gets one mention, in <em>Life, the Universe and Everything</em> , as the place Trillian flies the Heart of Gold to. In this episode, we also find out that Jon Hickman names his running shoes after his favourite sci-fi spaceships.  </p><h3>Almighty Bob</h3><p>The god whose existence is probably the most spurious, as he was likely invented by Old Thrashbarg. Here we share our favourite, possibly-offensive religious epithet and find out that Almighty Bob is a way for the people of Lamuella to exercise care in the community.</p><h3>Book recommendation</h3><p>This week we're recommending <a href="http://amzn.to/2vVzBIX">What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions</a>, by XKCD's Randall Munroe.
